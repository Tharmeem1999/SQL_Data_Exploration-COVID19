# SQL Data Exploration – COVID-19  
**(with Data Visualization in Tableau)**

## 📌 Introduction

In this project, I used **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to perform data exploration on COVID-19 datasets. After the SQL-based analysis, I created a **Tableau dashboard** to visualize key insights.

## 📊 Data Source

The dataset is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

> **Note:** The dataset may have changed since this project was created. To ensure reproducibility, I have included the original data files in this repository:
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx`
- `CovidVaccinations.xlsx`

## 🔍 Project Steps

1. **Downloading the Dataset**  
2. **Importing the Dataset into SQL Server**
3. **Exploring the Data using SQL**
4. **Creating Visualizations in Tableau**

A separate SQL file named **`Tableau Data Visualization Queries.sql`** contains the queries used for generating the dataset required for Tableau.

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard

The dashboard was created and published using **Tableau Public**. You can view it here:  
🔗 [Simple COVID Dashboard on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tharmeem.puthra/viz/SimpleCOVIDDashboard/Dashboard1)

> **Note:** Tableau Public does not support direct SQL file imports. Therefore, I exported the SQL query results to Excel, which are included in the `Tableau Table files` folder in this repository. These Excel files were then used to build the dashboard in Tableau Public.
